The write-once, run both ends framework for pure CouchApps.

By implementing and extending the CouchDB API in the browser, Kanso lets you write
your routing, rendering and validation functions once and have them run
client-side when possible, or on CouchDB as a fall-back.

This means highly-responsive web-apps, that are still search-engine friendly.
